This is a synthetic workflow

Execute it on a single node with workflow.py. You can modify it to scale it up

matmat: dense matrix multiply (the input dimensions must be a multiply of 8)
stream_sum, stream_scale, and stream_triad are three STREAM benchmarks, they each perform the operation of:
    SCALE:      a(i) = q*b(i)               
    SUM:        a(i) = b(i) + c(i)          
    TRIAD:      a(i) = b(i) + q*c(i)
